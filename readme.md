## Demos  

### Dictionary Suggest

* Derived from Strange Loop 2013 Presentation.

### Kinect/Hue Colors

* Also derived from Strange Loop 2013 Presentation.  
* This demo requires the Kinect for Windows SDK which is a free download from Microsoft.  

### Testing Demo

* Derived from samples on www.introtorx.com

### Interactive Example

* Not really interactive, I thought the immediate window was closer to a REPL than it is (it can't deal with lambdas)
